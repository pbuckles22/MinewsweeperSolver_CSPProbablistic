# Minesweeper RL Project Context

## üéØ **Project Overview**
This is a Reinforcement Learning environment for Minesweeper using Stable Baselines3 (PPO) and Deep Q-Network (DQN) with curriculum learning, MLflow tracking, and comprehensive testing. Optimized for M1 MacBook performance with GPU acceleration.

## üö® **CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT RULE** ‚ö° **NEW**
**When making ANY changes to the environment, reward system, or core functionality, IMMEDIATELY update the corresponding tests to match the new behavior. This prevents cascading test failures and ensures the test suite remains a reliable validation tool.**

**Examples of changes that require test updates:**
- Environment state representation changes (e.g., 2-channel ‚Üí 4-channel)
- Reward system modifications (e.g., neutral ‚Üí immediate rewards)
- Action space or masking changes
- Board size conventions or defaults
- Training configuration updates

**This rule was learned from the painful experience of updating from 2-channel to 4-channel state representation and neutral to immediate rewards, which caused widespread test failures across the entire test suite.**

## üèóÔ∏è **Key Design Decisions**

### **Simplified Reward System** ‚ö° **UPDATED**
- **Immediate Rewards**: Every safe reveal gets +15, every mine hit gets -20, wins get +500
- **No Special First-Move Logic**: Removed confusing pre-cascade neutral rewards
- **Clear Learning Signals**: Agent gets immediate feedback for all actions
- **Purpose**: Provides consistent learning signals without artificial distinctions

### **Enhanced State Representation** ‚ö° **NEW**
- **4-Channel State**: Game state + safety hints + revealed count + progress indicators
- **Channel 0**: Game state (revealed cells with numbers, unrevealed as -1, mine hits as -4)
- **Channel 1**: Safety hints (adjacent mine count for unrevealed cells)
- **Channel 2**: Revealed cell count (total revealed cells across board)
- **Channel 3**: Game progress indicators (safe bet flags for obvious safe cells)
- **Purpose**: Makes patterns more obvious to the agent for better learning

### **Smart Action Masking** ‚ö° **NEW**
- **Basic Masking**: Prevents revealing already revealed cells
- **Smart Masking**: Avoids cells that are guaranteed to be mines based on revealed information
- **Pattern Recognition**: Uses revealed cell numbers to identify guaranteed mines
- **Purpose**: Prevents obviously bad moves and guides agent toward better decisions

### **Curriculum Learning** ‚ö° **UPDATED**
- **7 Stages**: Beginner (4x4) ‚Üí Intermediate (6x6) ‚Üí Easy (9x9) ‚Üí Normal (16x16) ‚Üí Hard (16x30) ‚Üí Expert (18x24) ‚Üí Chaotic (20x35)
- **Dual Progression Modes**:
  - **Learning-Based** (Default): Allows progression with learning indicators for early stages
  - **Realistic** (Strict): Requires actual win rate achievement for all stages
- **Realistic Thresholds**: 15%, 12%, 10%, 8%, 5%, 3%, 2% win rates
- **Minimum Wins Required**: 1-3 wins per stage depending on difficulty
- **Adaptive Training**: More time for simpler stages (1.5x, 1.2x multipliers)
- **Backward Compatibility**: Old curriculum fully backed up
- **Purpose**: Progressive difficulty with flexible or strict progression options

### **Board Size Convention**
- **All board sizes use (height, width) format** throughout the codebase
- **Example**: `initial_board_size=(4, 3)` means height=4, width=3
- **This matches numpy/Gym conventions**

### **Reward System** ‚ö° **UPDATED**
```python
REWARD_SAFE_REVEAL = 15           # Every safe reveal (immediate)
REWARD_WIN = 500                  # Win reward (always given)
REWARD_HIT_MINE = -20             # Every mine hit (immediate)
REWARD_INVALID_ACTION = -10       # Invalid action penalty
```

### **Environment Features**
- **4-channel state representation**: Game state + safety hints + revealed count + progress indicators
- **Smart action masking**: Prevents obviously bad moves
- **Curriculum learning**: 7 stages with adaptive training times
- **MLflow integration**: Experiment tracking and model logging
- **M1 GPU Support**: Optimized for Apple Silicon with Metal Performance Shaders (MPS)

## üîß **Cross-Platform Test Compatibility** ‚ö° **NEW**

### **Test Suite Improvements**
The test suite has been enhanced to work seamlessly across all platforms (Mac, Windows, Linux) with the following improvements:

#### **Script Testing Flexibility**
- **Platform Detection**: Tests automatically detect the operating system
- **PowerShell Handling**: Tests check for PowerShell availability before using it
- **Content Validation**: When platform-specific tools aren't available, tests fall back to content-based validation
- **Permission Handling**: Different permission requirements per platform (executable vs readable)

#### **Cross-Platform Script Validation**
- **Output Handling**: Accepts various output methods (`echo`, `write-host`, `python`, `source`)
- **Error Handling**: Flexible validation for both simple and complex scripts
- **Environment Checks**: Validates both training and visualization scripts
- **Syntax Validation**: Platform-appropriate syntax checking

#### **Test Files Updated**
- `tests/scripts/test_run_script.py` - Cross-platform script validation
- `tests/unit/infrastructure/test_infra_run_scripts_unit.py` - Infrastructure test compatibility
- `tests/unit/infrastructure/test_infra_scripts_unit.py` - Script infrastructure compatibility

#### **Benefits for Development**
- **Consistent Testing**: Same test suite runs on all platforms
- **No Platform-Specific Failures**: Tests adapt to platform capabilities
- **Future-Proof**: New platforms will work without test modifications
- **Development Workflow**: Developers can switch between platforms seamlessly

### **Platform-Specific Considerations**

#### **Mac (macOS)**
- Uses shell scripts in `scripts/mac/`
- M1 GPU acceleration with Metal Performance Shaders (MPS)
- PowerShell not available (tests use content validation)

#### **Windows**
- Uses PowerShell scripts in `scripts/windows/`
- PowerShell syntax validation available
- Different permission model for scripts

#### **Linux**
- Uses shell scripts in `scripts/linux/`
- Similar to Mac but with different system paths
- PowerShell not available (tests use content validation)

### **Running Tests Across Platforms**
```bash
# All platforms use the same command
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Expected result: 739 tests passed, 0 failed
# All tests work regardless of platform
```

## üéØ **Critical Learning Insights** ‚ö° **UPDATED**

- **Performance**: M1 Mac with GPU acceleration significantly faster for training
- **Agent Learning**: Getting positive rewards (8-15 range) but not winning complete games yet
- **State Representation**: 4-channel state makes patterns more obvious to agent
- **Action Masking**: Smart masking prevents obviously bad moves
- **Monitoring Accuracy**: Enhanced monitoring correctly identifies learning progress vs real problems
- **Flexible Progression**: Learning-based progression works better than strict mastery requirements
- **Stage 7 Achievement**: Agent can reach Chaotic stage (20x35, 130 mines) with positive learning
- **Curriculum Flexibility**: Dual system allows both fast learning and realistic mastery
- **Progression Realism**: Strict progression ensures actual wins before advancing
- **DQN Agent Success**: Successfully implemented with enhanced features (Double DQN, Dueling DQN, Prioritized Replay)
- **DQN Training Progress**: Stage 2 achieved 24.3% training win rate, showing good learning
- **DQN Transfer Issues**: Model transfer between different board sizes needs attention (size mismatch errors)

## üéØ **Next Priorities** ‚ö° **UPDATED**
1. **Fix DQN Transfer Issues**: Resolve model loading errors between different board sizes
2. **Extend DQN Training**: Continue curriculum learning with proper model transfer
